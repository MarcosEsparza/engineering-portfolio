## About Me

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student with hands-on experience in aerospace systems and high-power rocketry, seeking a role where I can contribute to testing and analysis while deepening my technical skills through real engineering work. I’m currently the Aerodynamic Design Lead for Falcon Aeronautics and Space Team, focusing on fin can design, structural integration, and design iteration for our 10,000ft COTS rocket.

## Featured Project – IREC 2026: FAST 10k COTS Rocket  
**Role:** Aerodynamic Design Lead  
**Team:** Falcon Aeronautics & Space Team (FAST), UTPB  
**Tools:** SOLIDWORKS, MATLAB, OpenRocket, Excel

### Overview  
I am leading the aerodynamic design and fin-can integration for FAST’s 2026 Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) 10k COTS entry. My work focuses on fin geometry development, flutter and stability analysis, and coordination of structural and manufacturing designs for a fully modular aluminum fin-can system.

### Objectives  
- Reach **10,000 ft apogee** using commercial-off-the-shelf propulsion  
- Maintain **supersonic stability margins**  
- Develop a **bolt-in aluminum fin-can** with no adhesive load paths  
- Produce documentation aligned with the new **AIAA student-publishing track**

### Engineering Contributions  
- Designed fin surfaces and refined geometry using MATLAB flutter boundaries and OpenRocket iteration  
- Built the modular 4.02-in airframe model in SOLIDWORKS  
- Verified >**1.5× Vmax** flutter margin using custom MATLAB code  
- Integrated recovery system, avionics bay, and internal structure  
- Created documentation workflow for the 2026 technical report

### Latest Flight Simulation (L1500T)  
- **Apogee:** 10,990 ft  
- **Max velocity:** 1,191 ft/s (Mach 1.077)  
- **Max acceleration:** 431 ft/s²  
- **Stability margin at launch:** 2.76 cal (13.2%)  
- **CG:** 54.094 in  
- **CP:** 65.208 in
