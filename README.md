## About Me

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student with hands-on experience in aerospace systems and high-power rocketry, seeking a role where I can contribute to testing and analysis while deepening my technical skills through real engineering work. I’m currently the Aerodynamic Design Lead for Falcon Aeronautics and Space Team, focusing on fin can design, structural integration, and design iteration for our 10,000ft COTS rocket.
