## Featured Project — IREC 2026: FAST 10k COTS Rocket  
**Role:** Aerodynamic Design Lead  
**Tools:** SOLIDWORKS, MATLAB, OpenRocket, Excel

### Overview
- Leading aerodynamic design and fin-can development for the FAST 10k COTS rocket.  
- Responsibilities include fin geometry, flutter and stability analysis, airframe modeling, and integration of recovery and avionics systems.

### Key Contributions
- Developed fin geometry and performed flutter analysis using MATLAB and OpenRocket.  
- Modeled a 4.02 in modular airframe and aluminum fin-can in SOLIDWORKS.  
- Verified ≥1.5× Vmax flutter margin.  
- Integrated internal structure, recovery, and avionics into the CAD model.  
- Set up documentation workflow for the IREC 2026 technical report.  
- **MATLAB Code:** [Fin Flutter Solver](https://github.com/MarcosEsparza/Falcon-Aeronautics-and-Space-Team/blob/main/simulations/matlab/fin_flutter/AluminumFinCan.m)

### Flight Simulation — L1500T
